# Algorithms

This repository will serve as a reference of learning more about Algorithms.
It will be linked to a series of write-ups located on my blog - [gabrielleeyj.com](https://www.gabrielleeyj.com)

The Goal/Idea is to write a new Algorithm every week.


#### Algorithm 1 - Freivald's Algorithm - 29/01/2022 
Matrix multiplication with a randomized algorithm.

#### Algorithm 2 - Linked List - 07/02/2022
Linked List is a sequence of nodes that have properties and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
It is a linear data structure that is used to store data.

#### Algorithm 3 - Doubly Linked List - 14/02/2022
Doubly Linked List has a pointer to the node that is connected on either side of the list.
Each node is connected to two nodes, and is able to traverse forward or backwards through the nodes.  
***As this is a continuation of last week's algorithm no tests is created***
