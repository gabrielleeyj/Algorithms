# Algorithms

This repository will serve as a reference of learning more about Algorithms.
It will be linked to a series of write-ups located on my blog - [gabrielleeyj.com](https://www.gabrielleeyj.com)

The Goal/Idea is to write a new Algorithm every week.


#### Algorithm 1 - Freivald's Algorithm - 29/01/2022 
Matrix multiplication with a randomized algorithm.

#### Algorithm 2 - Linked List - 07/02/2022
Linked List is a sequence of nodes that have properties and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
It is a linear data structure that is used to store data.
